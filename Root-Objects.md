SCS Root Objects are special items, which serves as master objects for individual SCS Game Objects (see the chapter “Terminology”). Practically it means, that any object parented to the SCS Root Object automatically belongs to its content and such unit is then called SCS Game Object. It also carries various settings for the whole unit (like Parts and Variants) and can be edited in the SCS Object Specials palette.

You can create a Root Object by adding a Blender's standard “**EMPTY**” object and setting it as “Root Object” in “Object Type” option. You can find this option in Properties window, Object tab, SCS Object Specials within SCS Objects sub-palette.
