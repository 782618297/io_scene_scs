Day variation of window effect intended to be used for window interiors on building models. Main feature of this shader is interior mapping which is offsetting when viewing angle change (player gets feeling of moving interior behind the window). The amount of offsetting is defined by UV mapping on base texture. This variant is previewing day variant which uses only base texture.

As day/night variant is switched automatically in game it doesn't really matter if you are using day or night variant, as game automatically switches between day/night variants.
