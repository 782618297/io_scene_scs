Locators are used for placing of special items to the “SCS Game Model”.
To create a Locator the first thing you have to do is to create an Empty object (**Shift+A → Empty → \<any type>**).

Now while the object is active go to the Object Properties tab in Properties window and find “SCS Object Specials” palette. Here is the “SCS Objects” sub-palette, where you can change the Object Type. Change it to Locator type.

Now you can choose from three types of Locators in the Locator Type drop-down menu: Prefab, Model and Collision.
