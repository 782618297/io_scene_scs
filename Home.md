### Before you start

1. This tools provide new pipeline (as developers do it)
2. There are new formats. Why? "Because they are meant to be used for all of SCS games. Moreover if game changes it's internal formats, you won't have to reexport your models."
3. Old models can be reused partially. How? 
   1. Use any program or addon you are used to import the existing models. 
   2. Then export geometries in OBJ format or any format supported by Blender
   3. Import geometries in Blender
   4. Setup your model with SCS Blender Tools
