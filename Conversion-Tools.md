Content created with Blender Tools is written in mid-format which can be used in multiple SCS games. But all of the games use files written in binary format which may differ from game to game. That's why content exported with Blender Tools has to be converted to binary files in an extra step. 

Below you will find links to released conversion tools for our games. All the information about conversion
tools will be written there.
