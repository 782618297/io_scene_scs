Flavor marking surfaces using this flavor to be drawn after all others. So all shaders usingh this flavor will be drawn as last.

This behaviour somehow reassembles z-depth sorting among normal and shaders with decal flavor, thus this flavor shall be used on more or less any shader using blending mode (see [[shader flavor: add & over & mult]]).
