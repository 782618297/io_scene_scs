Looks in SCS games are used to define same model with different textures or material attributes. With this system you can easily extend your model to have several looks without exporting same geometry over and over again. Examples of typical look usage in SCS games are: gas stations, trailers, depot companies etc.

So each SCS Game Object inside Blender file has it's own definitions for looks. You can create, delete and edit look names in "SCS Looks" under "SCS Objects Specials" panel when SCS Root Object is active or "SCS Material Specials" panel when mesh object is active.
