Flavor defining special blending modes of shader. All of the three modes switches to transparent mode of shader and blend it with the surfaces beneath:

1. **Add** - will result as summary of accumulation buffers and surface using this blending mode,
4. **Over** - will just overlay opaque areas of surfaces using this blending mode over accumulation buffers,
3. **Mult** - will multiply accumulation buffers and surface using this blending mode.
