Use this material if you want your building windows to reflect at day-time and be lit at night. 
It effectively switches two materials depending on the time of the day. During the day it uses [[shader type: dif.spec.add.env]] material with texture for reflections and at night switches to "eut2.dif.lum.spec" in order for windows to light at the night. 
The texture must have alpha channel on places where it should have reflections and light at night.
