Beside exporting models from [[Export Panel]] you can export models from menu entry **SCS Formats (*.pim)**. It features the same behavior as export panel with exception that all files will be exported in selected directory.

> NOTE: even if you can select different directory it still has to be inside current SCS Project Base Path otherwise it would be impossible to reconstruct relative texture paths.
