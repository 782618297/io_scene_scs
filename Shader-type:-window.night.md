Night variation of window effect intended to be used for window interiors on building models. Main feature of this shader is interior mapping which is offsetting when viewing angle change (player gets feeling of moving interior behind the window). The amount of offsetting is defined by UV mapping on base texture. This variant is previewing night variant which uses multiplication between base & lightmap texture.

As day/night variant is switched automatically in game so it doesn't really matter which variant is used and exported.
