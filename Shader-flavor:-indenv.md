Special flavor used on [[shader type: dif.spec.add.env]] marking independent environment reflection from material specular color.

This gives user ability to use reflections also on surfaces where specular light is not reaching the surfaces. Example usage for this in Euro Truck Simulator 2 would be any part of reflective interior where sun never shines.
